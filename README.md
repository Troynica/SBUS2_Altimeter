# SBUS2_Altimeter
Arduino sketch for S.BUS2 telemetry device for model aircraft

This Arduino sketch reads data from an Meas MS5611 sensor and pushes derived telemetry data to an I2C-to-S.BUS interface. This interface sends it to an S.BUS2 equipped RC receiver so this telemetry data can be observed on the transmitter.
It also reads S.BUS data from the S.BUS2 port to detect no-signal and failsafe conditions to properly (re)set the zero point. The I2C-to-S.BUS2 interface provides a signal inverter.

It is primarily meant as a altimeter/variometer for RC model aircraft but extra functionality can easily be added.
